# AWS-S3-Event-Notification-System
This repository contains a Bash script that automates the creation of several AWS resources to set up a notification system triggered by changes (create or delete actions) in an S3 bucket. This system utilizes AWS services such as IAM, S3, Lambda, and SNS to implement an integrated solution.
